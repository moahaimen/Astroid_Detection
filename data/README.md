# Data (not included in this repository)

This repository contains the training/inference code and the full experiment pipeline, but the underlying dataset is **not** committed to GitHub to avoid sharing large files and to respect data-source terms.

## Dataset used in the paper

* Source: Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert cutouts (difference-image cutouts)
* Task: asteroid-like/moving-object detection in small cutouts
* Format: YOLO bounding-box labels (`.txt`) with normalized coordinates

## Expected directory structure

Place your dataset under `data/` using the following layout:

data/
ztf_yolo/
images/
train/
val/
test/
labels/
train/
val/
test/

## How to reproduce

1. Prepare the dataset in the structure above.
2. Update the dataset path inside the notebook (`Astroid_YOLO8.ipynb`) to point to `data/ztf_yolo/`.
3. Run the notebook from top to bottom.

## Notes

* If you are an editor/reviewer and need access to the dataset or a small evaluation subset to reproduce the results, please contact the corresponding author.
* All training logs, metrics, and model outputs are generated by the notebook during execution.
